i need to make a debug suite....

so i want to connect a proxy that can intercept the files
and perform some string replaceing before sending it to
the browser for ease of debugging...

working on an override for today will not guarantee that
it will work tomorrow... it usually doesnt....
thats why i want to do string replaceing or something
i want to run tests so thats i check that every string was
replaced or something idk yet...
